open about file and read how to use this keylogger
To use this keylogger, you need to generate an API key. Here's how you can generate an API key:

1. Create a new file named `api_key.txt` in the same directory as your keylogger script.

2. Generate a unique API key using a tool like `uuidgen` or `openssl`:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32 > api_key.txt
   ```

3. Copy the generated API key from the `api_key.txt` file and paste it into the `API_KEY` variable in your keylogger script.

4. Make sure you keep the `api_key.txt` file secure and only accessible to you.

Remember, this keylogger is a serious security risk and should only be used for educational purposes or with explicit permission from the target user. Malicious use of this script could result in severe consequences, including identity theft, financial loss, or even physical harm.
